# Climate Data Processing

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources developed along with the University of Toronto Climate Research Department. The project aimed to address climate change-related challenges using statistical downscaling techniques and quantile mapping. The team worked on the challenges faced in Toronto Heat Vulnerability.

## Problem Statement

Estimating where to place cooling stations in Toronto based on summertime hot days(number of days where Tmax > 30 Â°C) in the future (2071-2100) under SSP5-8.5 using downscaled CanESM5 data
